## What is Affiliate Marketing?

Affiliate marketing is a process by which an individual or company earns commission by selling or promoting products and services of another individual or business. It is often referred to as a business tactic, strategy, or process, but the goal remains the same – drive sales and generate revenue. Affiliate marketing helps to achieve the final goal quickly!

### What are the different types of Affiliate Marketing?

Affiliate marketing depends on the people or companies who advertise for merchants or brand. Hence, the types of affiliate marketing are differentiated as per the relationship or the involvement of the affiliate with the product, service or brand.

-   -   Unattached Affiliate Marketing – As the name suggests, there is no attachment of the affiliate marketer to the product, service or brand they are promoting Some of them may not even have any experience or expertise in the features and applications of what they are promoting. Their job is to promote as per predefined parameters. For example, a sportsperson promoting a beauty product.
    -   Related Affiliate Marketing – The level of involvement of the affiliate is more than that of the unattached affiliate. The attachment to the offering could include a platform dedicated to the niche. Since they could have a reasonable or high-level of expertise, they could influence decisions to generate traffic. Customers are more likely to trust a related affiliate marketing campaign over an unattached [marketing campaign](https://www.techmagnate.com/blog/how-measure-digital-marketing-campaign/). For example, reviewers sharing positive reviews about an electronic item – such vlogs are popular online.
    -   Involved Affiliate Marketing – In this type of affiliate marketing, there is a deep connection between the marketer and the offerings they are promoting. They could have used the product, and are more than happy to share views, advise and recommendations on the products benefits. The relationship and experience they have with the offerings make them the go-to-source for information for that niche. For example, food bloggers sharing their experience of dining at a restaurant.
