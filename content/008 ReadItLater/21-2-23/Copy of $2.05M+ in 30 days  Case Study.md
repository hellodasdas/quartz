Copy of $2.05M+ in 30 days | Case Study

**HOW WE SCALED THIS BRAND FROM $8k/day → $2.05M+ GENERATED IN 30 DAYS @ 18-20% NET PROFIT IN THE SPACE OF 6 MONTHS

OFFER:  
  
For Q4, we had only 1 offer change (we added a cart mystery gift) in total and started BFCM early, around 2 weeks prior.  
  
In Q3 we split-tested 4 different offers and ran with the best-performing one (% OFF)  
  
The main goal was to give the ad campaign the most amount of time possible to optimize & learn.  
  
We also did this intentionally as we wanted to make the Q4 ads applicable to BFCM ads (for the most part)  
  
*Basically making it partly-Evergreen for the entire Holiday Season  
  
Now we’re running the same video & static structure, but with Xmas Shipping Cutoff Date urgency-messaging.  
  
  
The biggest thing here was to test offers WAY BEFORE peak holiday-sale season/BFCM sale season,  
  
And put the most amount of spend on the SAME ads (so it has the MOST data).  
  
This was only possible because we:  
  
1. DIDN’T REINVENT THE WHEEL,  
2. STUCK WITH ONE OFFER, &  
3. HEAVILY SPLIT-TESTED MULTIPLE OFFERS WAY BEFORE PEAK SALE SEASON  
  
Things you can test:  
  
i. 25% + Free shipping vs. 30% off,

ii. BOGO,  
iii. Dollar ($) off vs. Percentage (%),  
iv. Free gift with purchase,  
v. Bundles,  
vi. Tiered-discount pricing (example [here](https://twitter.com/thedanielokon/status/1596230522069716992)), etc.  
  
Whichever offer does the best, SCALE THAT.  
  

MEDIA BUYING:  
  
Here’s all the ad spend in the last 30 days:

And here’s the full picture:  
  
How did we scale to these spend levels?  
  
1/ Use Triple Whale & Triple Pixel to make big spend decisions at campaign/adset/ad level  
  
2/ Focus more on MER, Blended ROAS, NC-ROAS & NC-Rev. to gauge overall marketing success across all channels.  
  

3/ Consider post purchase survey attributed responses to allocate budget levels per channel - this also helped us understand the blended performance of Google and Tiktok together

What did we do to prepare for scaling?  
  
1/ Shifted our ad angles to gift giving from other evergreen messaging to make it more seasonal and relevant. This shift was done early in november so the newer ads can learn and optimise before the peak rush

  

2/ Created and warmed up multiple whitelisting pages based on our audience persona to launch gifting ads across both branded & whitelisting ads  
  

3/ Re-launched historical BFCM and gifting Q4 ads that had a lot of social proof and engagement  
  
4/ Re-purposing top performing evergreen ads with BFCM sale callout and gifting hooks  
  
5/ Utilising dedicated Advantage+ SC campaigns for evergreen + BFCM specific ad units to get horizontal scale during the peak rush

  

Scaling Timestamp  
  
25th Nov (Black Friday) - $5.7k spend & 1.41x Triple Pixel ROAS and our top performing ads were whitelisting ads at $2k/day spend with BFCM’21 winning hook repurposed with the new UGC creator content.  
  
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DBDVDnWYCE_JRax4HtmMHuRZcnid6ZsmrIK9HaPnCNWadGDX98npEDV601wRSg4VbLY6fX21_fyQ_2Dnz2Rtm40e48StktItHL5hxoIQ_4NDI3GU32UvpZEgrSYmwapQxI5wKABjZQBJAsML4VAx0oc)  
  

27th Nov (BF Weekend) - $10k spend & 2.03x Triple Pixel ROAS and our top performing ads were whitelisting ads at $7k/day spend. We iterated on our winning ads and launched 3 new hooks keeping everything else the same  
  
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/b9oLV0KzblSJtrGN81uv76RHKyvOilWcfcB_EeHCzPpHJSVrdm5HHe0mLuq3c694cB3RK0TiF7r-wiHKR5Yyr84WEZutb8Q7ntyjUKMXDonW8942Hm6uSKtazeo9EGTHSkcKcg5ExoLMhjyijLcAv9I)  
  

  

1st December - $17.7k spend & 2.20x Triple Pixel ROAS and our top performing ads were the same whitelisting ads with 15k in spend alongside BFCM’21 gifting carousel ads that were relaunched. New hooks that were launched during the BFCM weekend were helping to horizontally scale whilst keeping ROAS intact

6th December - $20.9k spend and 1.86x Triple Pixel ROAS with 85%+ budget being allocated to top performing ads whilst the remaining 15% budget being utilised in scaling A+ SC and retargeting campaigns.  
  
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OezD3Bqea1zEjlddknKwHc0BabSU60v-lOpqWR3RSGWdM9gmq4mVz38_w4qOLtlhebyMkb6z6GvIiqD9WL5eMg52gHgSwAQytR81iAwdIOxt-xedejmcCrtPR4R8NwcAHUsbdD_LuIRC8sk863wAknw)  
  

8th December - $27.7k spend and 1.93x Triple Pixel ROAS with 70% budget allocated to top performing ads and the remaining budget allocated to new XMAS creative iterations and last call creatives highlighting shipping cut off urgency.  
  
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/O-PRkgZttJsSwYdCHHm1vA7ndPJI2QeTu6lHBvn8yYHXtfx1hxcTADq8GUx4rss4_pesnRJw_aa4SMBOeB1URo2mAfZrUMoM4twPPwLo4ON7liOrQ1TtgtY4Riih6_HojdKC5gDyizZVQQUgg0KFVAE)  
  
TL;DR  
  
- Broad Targeting  
- Advantage+ Campaigns  
- Whitelisting was the MAIN winner  
- Relaunching historically winning ads / top-performers in the past with new hooks  
- Scaling campaigns had 1-2 winning creatives EACH ad set (after tons of testing before)  
- 3-4 ad sets; Adset Budget Optimization  
- 70% - 100% budget increase on ad set level (scaling) every DAY due to:  
i. Proven Creatives,  
ii. Pixel & campaign fully optimized,  
iii. Offer & CRO optimized,  
iv. MER within ideal range for this specific brand  
- We 5x’ed ad budget because of how much pre-work done. Basically all vertical scaling. 

  
What we would have done differently for next Q4:  
  
1/ Split test different landing page types (listicles, advertorials) before Q4 hits to be able to maximise conversion rate during the peak rush.  
  
2/ Launch tiered discount offer to keep increasing the AOV and incentivise people to buy more products  
  
  
*I also additional info on how we scaled during the last 30-d period [here](https://twitter.com/ShaneJ_88/status/1603011965252603904).

CREATIVES:  
  
Things that were the most scalable/profitable:  
  
1. New UGC raw content that we repurposed heavily,  
2. Static/GIFs that were concise & easy-to-digest.  
  
1/ Just before BFCM week, we had 3 new raw content clips/footage (filmed on an iPhone) submitted by content creators,  
  
From these 3 pieces of raw content, we generated ~35+ new video ad iterations.  
  
What was the biggest ROI activity was split-testing the hook elements, i.e.  
  
a. Testing new reply-to-comment text on the overlays, for example:  
  
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vGHinfITGw0XgHFMSFqZ-Sb7CyRT0WF3zPX7_bvtc04ygDWanOUbp8mDg6x-pfhqUhhQfB1UcNjC5WkgNmKOans9HFVg-8SswSKcKh005DjxNQmG04Qt42VlqfOqEy-RMUFlwY9WzQXHn5kDF_F7_Lo) vs. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sEfRbgwIm4idUNUsHD36XmPiH8WFGEpRzPEVJ0TZVMVMPxKDPtrqwxPfDb-0KFF2-HwEGan88TP1S_S4JEf0LNYxi4MlOt3-WJlvj_QV23Lq7ph_rrJWRunxxEJSBCtlt1IzsR21bdg7mBx7zKs6LOg)  
  
^ Changing the text (and even avatar image) inside of these overlays can make a difference in performance  
  
b. Different copy on the first 3 seconds, (“The best gift for your husband” vs. “The perfect gift for your special someone”, etc. etc.)  
  
c. Adding the TikTok “robot voice” effect to the winning hooks (example [here](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/7kXmoM8RFi5YP0yCrco2?user=undefined)),  
  
d. Using last Q4’s Evergreen UGC winning ads as a template/benchmark for this year’s newer UGC content.  
  
e. “Last call” creatives that were filmed by the founder inside the warehouse. ← We used the TikTok reply-to-comment overlay here as well (Founder AMA-style vids).  
  
TL;DR - REPURPOSE YOUR CONTENT MORE.  
  

  
2/ For Static & GIFs, these creatives had 10-15% lower CPM compared to video ads,  
  
What we did was include anything about the offer, shipping time, discount code (if any), etc.,  
  
Basically everything they needed to know about the sale,  
  
In ONE SINGLE image ad.  
  
If the image did well, then we would turn it into a GIF to maximize repurpose value of that specific creative variation.  
  
Obvi makes amazing static ads that follow a similar structure, i.e.  
  
  
  
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dAPbpi4I7LmJj7eh8EK_gL1G84BqgF0VfVXe3uYykUTccnEqgWLEAzzFzfP_U7OHu1XiJ8CqRvU0KRUPLJNY921NrwIf11jb3zz9PV3h7bZjTBgsuGqQKxtuVLhnrR3xbVks2uWTcNylt67zSGvaXhU)![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f3BGypgfKuhksSUjASQCsmE1f-6alTcXKTTJVj1xLopBheiQ3x_bpyWnNjWv4O_hsprENIpnRCS_AI5mZTJ-vdKyv_lA_cqbx5v1QJGYZ9h7TGg45jjN3RCfwB95ZNDrKzmmYSD6uzgAULcvS6MC3DM)  
  
Notice they include social proof, benefits, a bold problem-solving headline, and usually a timeframe-based CTA in a single image.  
  
We also tent to include a real, physical review (text-format) in a bubble overlay on these statics as well.  
  
You can make elements move around (basically turning that static into a GIF) on [Canva](http://canva.com) ([example](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/1qJh3TVZjrgZMNTYts2H?user=undefined))
